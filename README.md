#### Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) Reconnaissance Flashcards

I build this while studying visual reconnaissance of RFID badge readers.

##### Use the Anki flashcard application:
- https://apps.ankiweb.net/

`Anki` is a very popular flashcard application and is avaliable on all major platforms including mobile.

Just download and install `Anki`. Then `import` the `.apkg` flashcard deck to get started!

##### Please keep in mind that this is a draft and likely contains errors..
##### There are also certainly some badge reader brands I have not yet included. I will be improving this over time.

Badge readers marked with a `*****` are still under review.
