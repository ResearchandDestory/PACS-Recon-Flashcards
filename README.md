### Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) Reconnaissance Flashcards

I build this while studying visual reconnaissance of RFID badge readers for covert entry.

#### Use the Anki flashcard application:
- https://apps.ankiweb.net/

`Anki` is a very popular flashcard application and is avaliable on all major platforms including mobile.

Just download and install `Anki`. Then `import` the `.apkg` flashcard deck to get started!

#### Please keep in mind that this may contain errors.. If you find an error please let me know!
#### There are also certainly more PACS brands/product lines I have not included yet. See the list below for more information.

_Any badge readers marked with `*****` is still under review._

_If there is something I'm missing please let me know and I'll add them. Thanks!_
